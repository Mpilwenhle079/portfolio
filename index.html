        Hello, I'm Mpilwenhle Ndlela. Welcome to my digital portfolio.
        I'm a passionate ICT student specializing in Business Analysis at DUT.
        I began my academic journey in 2024 after completing matric in 2023.
        This space reflects my journeyâ€”where analytical thinking meets real-world problem solving.
        I'm currently working on an integrated system project using C#, CSS, and SQL.
        I work with technologies like C#, HTML, CSS, and SQL to build dynamic, user-friendly systems.
        This portfolio was built using HTML, CSS, and PHP.
        In my first year, I studied C# programming, Cyber Security, System Analysis, and Business Analysis.
        In my second year, I focused on C# MVC architecture, SQL, and advanced database systems.
        In my third year, I advanced my skills in System Design and Business Analysis.

         Thank you for taking the time to explore my journey. Iâ€™m not just seeking a roleâ€”Iâ€™m ready to bring value, vision, and dedication to your team.
          Letâ€™s build something meaningful together.
